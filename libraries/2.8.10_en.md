## Update Highlights

### Modpack Import Optimization

* Support for the installation of modpacks that contain both modpack files and launchers (Lazy Packs).

> [!caution]

> When importing such compressed packages, the bundled launcher will automatically be used for subsequent installations.

> This ensures that even when players import modpacks using their own PCL, they will still be able to view the designated background image, homepage, and music.

The following format is currently the most recommended for distributing Lazy Packs:

* Support for recognizing and importing compressed files that contain multiple nested folders ([#4950](https://github.com/Hex-Dragon/PCL2/issues/4950), @NorthZeroD)

* Accurate progress display when extracting or copying files.

* When beginning the installation of a modpack, the process will automatically navigate to the download management page.

* After successfully importing a compressed file, the application will automatically redirect to the version selection page.

* Upon importing a compressed file or auto-importing a modpack, the default name will be set automatically without prompting the user for input.

* When auto-importing a modpack, the imported folder will be added to the folder list without requiring user confirmation.
